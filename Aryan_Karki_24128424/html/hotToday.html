                <p class="bd i">The latest episode of Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 saw the passing of the fan-favorite teacher and mentor Nanami. Before being killed by Mahito in Episode 18, titled "Right and Wrong," an emotional montage of Nanami's life plays. He reflects on the stress of being a Jujutsu Sorcerer and the mundane but meaningful encounter he had with a woman from a local bakery. "Malaysia. I should go to Kuantan," Nanami says before his death. "I'll build a house on an empty beach. I'm tired. I'm really tired." The scene then shifts back and forth from Nanami on a beach in Kuantan and the present as he battles disfigured humans. While most Jujutsu Kaisen fans voiced their grief on social media, one fan went even further, creating the Kento Nanami Memorial Shrine in Kuantan in his memory.</p>

                <p class="bd ii">In an interview with Crunchyroll in Anime NYC, Hajime Isayama revealed how he had several regrets from the time he created the ending as he now had several new ideas. He had gotten influenced by the anime and was hoping to depict Eren as a nicer guy. Thus, he claimed to have changed the direction of the story a lot. However, it is yet to be seen what changes has he made to the ending. After the debut of the anime, however, fans seem to love the ending. It's chiefly because the pacing was better, and some of the atrocious dialogues, including Armin's infamous "thank you" to Eren, were changed significantly. The reaction from the anime watchers has only been positive.</p>

                <span class="title trd">When will Egghead Arc be animated?</span>
                <p class="bd iii">The Wano Country arc in One Piece is finally reaching its end after successfully running for over four years now. This arc began all the way back on June 23, 2019, with episode 890, and after its four-year run with over 148 chapters spanning over 195 episodes, it came to an end with episode 1085, which aired recently. Now that the Wano Country arc has concluded, every One Piece fan is wondering about the next arc that the anime will adapt. As the title reveals, the next arc that will be adapted in the One Piece anime is the Egghead arc.
                </p>
                <p class="bd iv">
                    With Episode 1085, the lengthy Wano Country Saga is now officially over in the anime. Hence, it is time to witness the next saga, the 11th saga of the One Piece series, titled the “Final Saga” by well-known author Eiichiro Oda.
                </p>
                <p class="bd v">
                    As the name implies, it's the beginning of the fantastic end of One Piece. And the first arc we have here in this yet another epic saga is called the “Egghead arc” aka Future Island arc, which started from chapter 1058 in the manga.
                    Therefore, the official production team behind the One Piece anime has now officially announced that the broadcast for the Egghead Island arc will begin on January 7, 2024. The anime will be adapting volume 105 of the manga, which will cover chapter 1061 - unknown (as the Future Island arc is currently ongoing).</p>
